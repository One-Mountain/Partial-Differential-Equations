# Partial-Differential-Equations

Will be expanded, but for now:

Shows examples of the wave and heat equation using MATLAB: 

Utt + cUt = Uxx

U(0, t) = 0, Ux(1, t) = 0, U(x, 0) = f(x), Ut(x,0) = 0

where f(x) = 4x for 0 < x < 1/4
           = 1 for 1/4 < x < 1
           = don't care o/w

Ut = Uxx 
Same initial conditions
